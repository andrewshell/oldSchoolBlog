   * Problem reported by Brent Simmons:
      * If I go to scripting.com, then click the Links tab, then click the Blog tab, I donï¿½t see like buttons or counts on the page. (Using Safari on latest MacOS.)

   * More work on Twitter comments
      * The symbolic characters in the buttons are lower opacity
         * they're too strong visually
      * The title of the dialog is a function of the contents of the post
         * for titled items it's the title
         * for untitled items it's the first N characters
      * The character counter starts out with the right value

   * Adding Twitter comments to Scripting News
      * Cancel button and close box on dialog
      * How many characters to reserve for a URL?
      * Each tweet has a #scriptingnews hashtag and the URL of the post it's in reply to.
      * If you're not logged on, clicking the Twitter icon takes you to the logon page on Twitter, as the Likes feature does.

   * all posts are by default likeable starting Nov 22, 2018.
      * you can still make one not likeable by adding an fllikeable attribute with the value false.
